# unit-4-game
crystal counter hw for week 4. jQuery used. 

**Note**
    crystal's randomly generated #s between 1-12.
    Guess number is randomly generated between 19-120.

How the Game Works: 
    1. User is given a random # at the start.
    2. There are 4 crystals below. By clicking on a crystal the user will add a specific amount of points to your total score. 
    3. The user wins by matching their score total to the randomized number. The user loses if their total score exceeds the randomized number. 
    4. The values of the crystals are hidden until the user clicks on it.
    5. A randomized number is generated after each time the user wins or loses.

Strategy: 
    1. Create HTML with key words:
        a. set up structure and words. 
        b. find crystal images.
    2. Begin jQuery
